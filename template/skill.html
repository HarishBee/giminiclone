    <h1 >AI SKILLS</h1>
    <h2>AI do all kinds of neat stuff</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Machine Learning:</span> is perhaps one of the most important skills in AI. Machine learning algorithms enable systems to learn from data, identify patterns, make predictions, and improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed.</li>
        <li><span>Deep Learning:</span> Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to learn from large amounts of data. It has been particularly successful in tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.</li>
        <li><span>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</span> NLP is the ability of computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This skill is essential for applications such as language translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and virtual assistants.</li>
        <li><span>Computer Vision: </span> vision enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the real world. It is used in applications such as image recognition, object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous vehicles.</li>
        <li><span>Reinforcement Learning:</span> Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. It is used in applications such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.</li>
        <li><span>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning:</span> This skill involves representing knowledge in a structured format and using logic-based reasoning to manipulate and infer new knowledge from existing knowledge bases.</li>
        <li><span>Probabilistic Reasoning:</span> Probabilistic reasoning enables AI systems to deal with uncertainty by using probability theory to make decisions and draw inferences based on uncertain or incomplete information.</li>
        <li><span>Search Algorithms:</span> Search algorithms are used to find optimal solutions to problems by exploring a search space and identifying the best sequence of actions to achieve a goal. They are used in applications such as route planning, scheduling, and optimization.</li>
        <li><span>Planning and Decision Making:</span> AI systems need to be able to plan and make decisions in complex environments. This involves algorithms and techniques for reasoning about goals, actions, and states to achieve desired outcomes.</li>
        <li><span>Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:</span> Before applying machine learning algorithms, data often needs to be preprocessed and features need to be extracted or engineered to make them suitable for analysis.</li>
